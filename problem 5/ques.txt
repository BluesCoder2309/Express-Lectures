Objectives:

i) Implement the provided 'renderStatic' function in 'index.js' to render the 'index.html' file provided inside the 'public' directory in response to the GET request 'localhost:5000/index.html'.

Notes:

    Use the 'express.static' middleware to serve static files.
    Ensure that the file path is correctly resolved when serving the 'index.html' file.


Expected Output:

Upon receiving a GET request to 'localhost:5000/index.html', the server should render and return the contents of the 'index.html' file as the response.
