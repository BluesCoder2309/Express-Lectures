Implement the "logRequest" middleware function to achieve the following functionalities:

    Ensure the middleware is executed for every GET request at the root path ("/").
    Log the request method and path separately to the console.


Notes:
Access the request method and path information using the 'req' object's 'method' and 'path' attributes.
